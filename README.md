## Shell Packages
##### Zsh
I saw someone using this shell and they had some really cool configs, so I stole them. It has some nice features like native tab completion as well as themeing for the prompt.

##### Zsh-Syntax-Highlighting
This is mostly for aesthetics, since I only use the terminal for executing simple commands. Useful for those who like to make long strings of commands and cannot find mistakes just by glancing at some plain-colored text.

---

## Basic Packages
##### Termite
My terminal emulator of choice. Config file is a bit annoying to take care of, because it gives me one more place where I need to manage color schemes. A positive though, is that it easily handles fonts such as [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

##### Neofetch
One of the better looking, and most feature-rich system information fetchers that I have found.

##### Infinality-Bundle
Improves font rendering throught the system. I have not done a side-by-side comparison of with and without these patches, but I trust them. My fonts didn't look worse, so it has that going for it.

##### Wget
A tool used for viewing and downloading files from the internet. I installed this because something that I stole from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) used it. I could probably have just rewrote the command for curl, but that would be too much work.

##### Unzip
I download files. Sometimes those files are compressed in the zip format. This lets me decompress them.

##### Unrar
See above entry.

##### Xclip
Used for manipulating the clipboard. Really nice for storing image files like screenshots from within scripts.

## Window Management Packages
##### Laziness

---

## Text Editor Packages
##### Atom
Nice text editor. It is based on chrome, so anyone that knows web development can easily hack it. I only somewhat know what I'm doing with that. I guess that's why it's called hacking.

##### Gvfs
Atom was yelling at me to install this in order to delete files. I installed it.

## Programming Packages
##### Jdk
I've been trying to learn Java. Having the development kit is necessary for that.
